#VOSER
###Vojtův Otevřený Simulátor Exteriérových Reproduktorů
###Vojta's open simulator of speakers for exteriors

Project VOSER is meant to be simple program for computing acoustic field produced by multiple sources.

This program is intended as tool for designing subwoofer arrays for outdoors PA applications. This program (currently) does not count for sound reflection. You can still use for designing your sub configuration, but keep in mind this limitations.

Currently I am working on pure 2D simulation of idealised point sources.

**This program is in early stages of development. It may not work properly.**

Documentation is "work in progress". I plan to write elaborate  with model explanation.

Oneof main goals ot this program was for me to learn Python, Numpy, (Pt)Qt and to revive my mathematics knowledge.
